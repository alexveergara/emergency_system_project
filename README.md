# Emergency system project

The aim of this project is to classify patients according to their health status, focusing on the detection of cardiac events. 
The decisions taken by the algorithm are based on the variables recorded by a smartwatch, such as ECG, blod pressure or heart rate. 

Files:
* smartwatch.ipynb works with smartwatch variables, performing data cleansing, feature engineering and clustering, which allows to distingish healthy, low-risk and high-risk patients.
* ecg.ipynb works with ECG signals, performing data cleansing, feature analysis, feature selection and model selection and evaluation. 
* dashboard file contains a PowerBI dashboard that allows data visualization to extract information of the poulation of the study and the input variables and present an initial approach of how this system could be brought to real life.
